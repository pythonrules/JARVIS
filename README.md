# JARVIS
This is everything that is related to an IRL JARVIS. All iterations are available for the public here.

JARVIS is inspired by Iron Man. This repository will hold all iterations of this using python and the power of CHAT-GPT/Perplexity.

It will be able to control appliances in my house and be able to hack various things with computer chips. 

Currently the first iterations will be able to do tasks for me such as ordering pizza.
